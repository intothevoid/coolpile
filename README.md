Update - This project was abandoned due to a job change and lack of time! I hope to get back to it someday :)

My attempt at writing a compiler for the COOL programming language. 

COOL stands for Classroom Object Oriented Language and is quite popular as a means to learn how to write compilers. From the Wikipedia page -

"Cool, an acronym for Classroom Object Oriented Language, is a computer programming language designed by Alexander Aiken for use in an undergraduate compiler course project. While small enough for a one term project, Cool still has many of the features of modern programming languages, including objects, automatic memory management, strong static typing and simple reflection."
